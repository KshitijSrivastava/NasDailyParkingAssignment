# Car Parking API

## Backend Python Assignment | Nas Daily


The candidate will create three API endpoints which are mentioned below:

1. Park a Car: The Endpoint will be given the car number as input and outputs the slot
where it is parked. If the parking lot is full, the appropriate error message is returned.
2. Unpark the Car: This endpoint takes the slot number from which the car is to be removed
from and frees that slot up to be used by other cars.
3. Get the Car/Slot Information: This endpoint can take either the slot number or car
number and return both the car number and slot number for the input.
